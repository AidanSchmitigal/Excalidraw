# Excalidraw Collaboration Server

This is a fork of [excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) and [excalidraw-room](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-room) and [excalidraw-storage-backend](https://gitlab.com/kiliandeca/excalidraw-storage-backend) with some modifications.

## Usage

There is a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory, with all the required services.
